This folder is dedicated to showcasing how Cross-Communication (XComs) can be utilized in Apache Airflow to enable data sharing between tasks in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

## What Are XComs?

XComs in Airflow are a method for tasks within the same DAG to communicate or share data with each other. They facilitate the passing of small snippets of data from one task to downstream tasks, enhancing coordination and communication across the workflow. XComs are ideal for transmitting statuses, intermediate results, or metadata and are not intended for large data transfers, as the size should generally be limited to a few kilobytes.

## How to Use XComs

XComs work with two primary functions:

- **xcom_push():** This method is used by a task to send data to XCom.
- **xcom_pull():** This method allows a task to retrieve data sent to XCom by another task.

### Key Features

- **Lightweight Data Exchange:** XComs provide a simple way to pass data between tasks without needing external data storage or complicated data transfer mechanisms.
- **Workflow Orchestration:** They help in managing dependencies and conditions within a workflow, based on the data shared between tasks.

### Example Use Case

The provided DAG, xcom_example, demonstrates a basic use of XComs where:

1. **push_data** task uses xcom_push() to send a string message.
2. **pull_data** task retrieves this message using xcom_pull().

This example illustrates how tasks can collaborate by passing essential information seamlessly during the execution of a DAG.
